// npm => node package manager

//npm is like playstore for node.js where the all usefull packages available. 
// package => pre writen code to increase productivity and save time.

//for example if I want to build a text to speech converter then the main function is already will be available in npm.(Don't think it's just a example there are really so many packages already availabe in npm you can check them out by going into npmjs.com and also search what kind of package you want)

// to install the packages from npm type npm i (and the name of the package)
